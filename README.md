Assignment status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

## Instructions:
The pdf has all the basic instructions, but here are some additional guidelines.
- [ ] Include your written work in the form of a pdf! Please title the pdf 'HW1.pdf' when uploading to your repository.
- [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in the appropriately named "Prob3.py" file already in the repository. Make sure to fill in the meta-data in the comments at the top!
- [ ] Code for Problem 4 should be done in the also appropriately named "Prob4.py" file in the repository. Again, please fill out the meta-data in the comments at the top, it might not be the same as for Problem 3.
	* An animate gif for helping to better understand the range of motion in Problem 4 is in the Images folder.


If you have issues or come across problems or parts of the instructions that are unclear, please don't hesitate to ask on Campuswire or via email or in person!

Don't wait until the last minute to try to make it through everything! Computers (and code) have a way of sensing your desperation and choosing that exact moment to have the most random things go wrong!
