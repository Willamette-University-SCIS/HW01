# Problem Set 1

Assignment status: PENDING

_Please change the above PENDING to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of January 30 at midnight!

## Instructions:
The pdf has all the basic instructions, but here are some additional guidelines.
- [ ] Include your written work in the form of a pdf! Please title the pdf 'HW1.pdf' when uploading to your repository.
- [ ] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the file called `Prob2.py` in the repository. Please fill out the meta-data information in the comments at the top of the template!
- [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in the file called `newspeak.py`. Again, please fill out the meta-data information, as it may not be the same.
- [ ] Code for Problem 4 should be done in `Prob4.py`! Don't forget meta-data at the top please! This problem is left pretty flexible for how you can approach it, so I could not write any auto-tests for it.

If you have issues or come across problems or parts of the instructions that are unclear, please don't hesitate to ask on Discord or via email or in person!

_Don't wait until the last minute to try to make it through everything! Computers (and code) have a way of sensing your desperation and choosing that exact moment to have the most random things go wrong!_


#### Testing:
This class will have an auto-testing framework applied to the majority of problems this semester. As such, whenever you commit new material to your repository, a sequence of tests will be run against your code to see if it is meeting all the desired requirements. If you get a green checkmark, it means everything is passing! I still look at all code in person though, so if an auto-test is failing for some silly reason, know that I'll look and score your code myself, not the auto-test.
