# Homework 01

Assignment status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of January 31 at midnight!

## Instructions:
The pdf has all the basic instructions, but here are some additional guidelines.
- [ ] Include your written work in the form of a pdf! Please title the pdf 'HW1.pdf' when uploading to your repository.
- [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in the appropriately named "Prob3.py" file already in the repository. Make sure to fill in the meta-data in the comments at the top! Also only print out the requested item, nothing else.
- [ ] Code for Problem 4 should be done in the also appropriately named "Prob4.py" file in the repository. Again, please fill out the meta-data in the comments at the top, it might not be the same as for Problem 3. Again, only print out the total area, nothing else.
	* Some gifs for helping to better understand the setup and range of motion in Problem 4 are in the Images folder.


If you have issues or come across problems or parts of the instructions that are unclear, please don't hesitate to ask on Campuswire or via email or in person!

_Don't wait until the last minute to try to make it through everything! Computers (and code) have a way of sensing your desperation and choosing that exact moment to have the most random things go wrong!_


#### Testing:
This class will have an auto-testing framework applied to the majority of problems this semester. As such, whenever you commit new material to your repository, a sequence of tests will be run against your code to see if it is meeting all the desired requirements. A colored badge in your README should change green to reflect that everything is passing or red to indicate that something failed. I'll show you in class how you can get more feedback on which test(s) are failing so you can see about fixing that issue!
